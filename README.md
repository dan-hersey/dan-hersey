### What I'm Working On

🏦 **Bitcoin Banking** — Helping banks unlock new revenue streams through bitcoin-backed lending, BTC treasury services, and crypto-native products

📊 **Regulatory Intelligence** — Tracking OCC guidance and regulatory developments that are opening doors for bitcoin in traditional banking
