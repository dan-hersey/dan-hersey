# Hey, I'm Dan 👋

I lead marketing at [Galoy](https://galoy.io), where we're building bitcoin-native banking infrastructure for financial institutions ready to embrace the future of money. I'm also the founder of the [Rhode Island Bitcoin Policy Initiative (RIBPI)](https://ribpi.com), Rhode Island's first independent think tank dedicated to sound money and responsible Bitcoin policy.

## What I'm Working On

### 🏦 Bitcoin Banking (Galoy)
Helping banks unlock new revenue streams through bitcoin-backed lending, BTC treasury services, and crypto-native products. At Galoy, we're building open-source core banking infrastructure that brings banking into the Bitcoin age.

### 📊 Regulatory Intelligence (RIBPI)
Tracking OCC guidance and regulatory developments that are opening doors for bitcoin in traditional banking. Through RIBPI, I work with state legislators—including Senator Peter Appollonio on [Senate Bill 2021](https://legiscan.com/RI/bill/S2021/2026)—to craft sensible legislation that supports financial innovation while protecting consumers.

### 🚀 Go-to-Market
Building the playbook for how banks adopt bitcoin infrastructure—bridging the gap between complex financial concepts and clear, actionable strategies.
